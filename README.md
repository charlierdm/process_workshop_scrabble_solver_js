This is my solution for the Makers Academy Scrabble_Solver Process Workshop written in JavaScript, test driven using Jasmine. All tests are passing.

```
<strong>Requirements</strong>

Given a word, compute the scrabble score for that word.

Letter Values
You'll need these:

| Letter      | Value | 
| :---        |    :----:   |       
| A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T      | 1      | 
| D, G   | 2        | 
| B, C, M, P | 3 |
| F, H, V, W, Y | 4 |
| K | 5 |
| J, X | 8 |
| Q, Z | 10 |

Examples "cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:

3 points for C
1 point for A, twice
3 points for B, twice
2 points for G
1 point for E
And to total:

3 + 2x1 + 2x3 + 2 + 1

= 3 + 2 + 6 + 3

= 14

```
